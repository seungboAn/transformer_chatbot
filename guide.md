## React.js Chatbot AI Application MVP Requirements (Transformers & Supabase) - Revised based on Supabase Roadmap

This document outlines the React.js requirements for building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) chatbot AI application using transformers and Supabase, incorporating best practices from the Supabase Roadmap.  It assumes basic familiarity with React, JavaScript, and fundamental AI/ML concepts. This MVP focuses on core functionality and a simple user experience to validate the core concept.

**1. Core Libraries and Dependencies:**

*   **React:** ^18.0.0 (or latest) - The foundation.
*   **@supabase/supabase-js:** ^2.0.0 (or latest) - Supabase client library.
*   **transformers.js:** ^2.6.0 (or latest) - For transformer models and tokenizers. Browser-optimized build.
*   **axios:** ^1.0.0 (or latest) - For API requests (primarily to Supabase Functions).

**2. UI Components and Design (Simplified for MVP):**

*   **Chat Interface:**
    *   **Chat Input:** `<textarea>` for message input, "Send" button.
    *   **Message Display:** Basic rendering of messages in a scrollable `div`. User/Bot message differentiation.
    *   **No Conversation History for MVP:** Focus on current interaction.
*   **Styling:** Basic CSS for layout and readability. No CSS framework initially.
*   **Accessibility:** Basic ARIA attributes for input and message display. Full accessibility post-MVP.

**3. State Management (Simplified for MVP):**

*   **Conversation State:** `useState` for current conversation (messages in current interaction).
*   **No User Data Management for MVP:** Focus on anonymous interaction.

**4. Integration with Transformers and Supabase:**

*   **Model Selection:** DistilBERT (or similar lightweight, browser-friendly model). Prioritize speed and feasibility.
*   **No Fine-tuning for MVP:** Use a pre-trained model directly.
*   **API Integration:** **Supabase Functions** handle transformer model interaction. React frontend calls Supabase Functions.
*   **Data Storage (For MVP - No Persistence):** Messages are *not* persisted in the database *initially*.  This simplifies the MVP.  *Consider* a very basic persistence strategy (e.g., local storage) if browser refresh becomes a major usability issue for testing.  Long-term storage will be addressed post-MVP.
*   **Security (Basic for MVP):** Supabase's built-in authentication for Function access. Input sanitization in Supabase Functions.  RLS is *not* a primary concern for the MVP due to lack of persistent data, but will be crucial later.

**5. Testing and Deployment (Simplified for MVP):**

*   **Testing:** Basic manual testing for core functionality.
*   **Deployment:** Vercel/Netlify for React frontend. Supabase Functions within Supabase.

**6. Additional Considerations (MVP Focus):**

*   **Performance Optimization (Crucial for MVP):** Lightweight model, efficient API calls, minimized DOM updates. Browser performance is paramount.
*   **User Experience (Basic for MVP):** Clean, functional interface. Clear distinction between user/bot messages.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Basic input filtering for offensive language. More comprehensive considerations post-MVP.

**7. Supabase Specific Considerations (from Roadmap):**

*   **Supabase Project Setup:** Create the project, familiarize with dashboard.
*   **Database Schema (Minimal for MVP):**  For the *MVP*, the schema is very simple (no persistence initially).  *Plan* for the schema needed later (users, messages, etc.).
*   **Supabase Client Library:** Use `@supabase/supabase-js` in the React frontend.
*   **Supabase Functions:** Implement chatbot logic (input processing, model interaction, response generation) *within* Supabase Functions.
*   **Authentication (Not for Initial MVP):**  Supabase Auth will be integrated *later* for user accounts.
*   **Storage (Not for Initial MVP):** Supabase Storage for file uploads will be considered *later*.
*   **Real-time Updates (Potentially for MVP):**  If feasible with minimal effort, explore Supabase Realtime for instant message updates.  If not, basic polling is acceptable for the MVP.
*   **Edge Functions (Post-MVP):**  Not relevant for the initial MVP.
*   **Monitoring/Logging:**  Use Supabase's tools *as needed* during development.

**Technology Choices Justification (Revised):**

*   **DistilBERT:** Balance of performance and size.
*   **Supabase Functions:** Easy deployment, integration with Supabase.
*   **No CSS Framework:** Lightweight MVP.
*   **No Redux/Context (Initially):** `useState` sufficient for MVP scope.

This revised MVP definition prioritizes getting a functional chatbot integrated with Supabase, leveraging Supabase Functions for the core logic.  It defers features like persistent data, user authentication, and advanced UI elements to post-MVP development, allowing for a faster initial iteration.  It also explicitly addresses key points from the Supabase Roadmap.
